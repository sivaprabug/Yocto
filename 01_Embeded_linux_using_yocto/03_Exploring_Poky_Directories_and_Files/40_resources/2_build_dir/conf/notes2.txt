bblayers.conf
------------------

The bblayers.conf file tells BitBake what layers you want considered during the build.

By default, the layers listed in this file include layers minimally needed by the build system

However, you must manually add any custom layers you have created

E.g: BBLAYERS = "\
                                  /home/linuxtrainer/poky/meta \
                                 /home/linuxtrainer/poky/meta-poky \
                                 /home/linuxtrainer/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
                                 /home/linuxtrainer/poky/meta-mylayer \
                                 "
This example enables four layers, one of which is a custom user defined layer named "meta-mylayer"
