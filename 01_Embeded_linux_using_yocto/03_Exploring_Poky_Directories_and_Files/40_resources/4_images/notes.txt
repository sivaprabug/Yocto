Images generated by Poky Build
---------------------------------

The build process writes images out to the Build Directory inside the tmp/deploy/images/machine/ folder

1. kernel-image: 
		A kernel binary file
		The KERNEL_IMAGETYPE variable determines the naming scheme for the kernel image file.
		$ bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^KERNEL_IMAGETYPE=

2. root-filesystem-image: 
		Root filesystems for the target device (e.g. *.ext3 or *.bz2 files).
		The IMAGE_FSTYPES variable determines the root filesystem image type
		$ bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^IMAGE_FSTYPES=

3. kernel-modules:
		Tarballs that contain all the modules built for the kernel

4. bootloaders:
		If applicable to the target machine, bootloaders supporting the image.

symlinks
