Immediate Variable Expansion (:=)
-----------------------------------

The ":=" operator results in a variable's contents being expanded immediately, rather than when the variable is actually used

A = "11"
B = "B:${A}"
A = "22"
C := "C:${A}"
D = "${B}"


A = "11"
B := "B:${A}"
A = "22"
C := "C:${A}"
D = "${B}"
