Setting a weaker default value (??=)
-------------------------------------

Weaker default value is achieved using the ??=  operator

Difference between ?= and ??=
-------------------------------

Assignment is made at the end of the parsing process rather than immediately.

When multiple "??=" assignments exist, the last one is used

Eg.
--------

MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
MACHINE ??= "qemuarm"

If MACHINE is not set, the value of MACHINE = "qemuarm"
If MACHINE is set, before the statements, then the value will not be changed

It is called weak assignment, as assignment does not occur until the end of the parsing process.

Note: "=" or "?=" assignment will override the value set with "??="
