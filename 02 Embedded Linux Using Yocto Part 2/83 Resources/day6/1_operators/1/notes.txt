Basic Variable Setting (=)
---------------------------

VARIABLE = "value"

The following example sets VARIABLE to "value".

Eg. MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"

This assignment occurs immediately as the statement is parsed

It is a "hard" assignment

If you include leading or trailing spaces as part of an assignment, the spaces are retained:

VARIABLE = " value"
VARIABLE = "value "

Note: You can also use single quotes ('') instead of double quotes when setting a variable's value
Benefit:

VARIABLE = 'I have a " in my value'
