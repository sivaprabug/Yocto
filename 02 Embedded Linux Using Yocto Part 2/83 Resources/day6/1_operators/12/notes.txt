Override Style Operation Advantages
----------------------------------

An advantage of the override style operations "_append", "_prepend", and "_remove" as compared to the "+=" and "=+" operators is that the override style operators provide guaranteed operations

IMAGE_INSTALL += "usbutils"

IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils"
