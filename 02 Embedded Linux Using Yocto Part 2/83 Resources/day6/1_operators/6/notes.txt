Variable Expansion
-------------------

Variables can reference the contents of other variables using a syntax that is similar to variable expansion in Bourne shells

A = "hello"
B = "${A} world"

$ bitbake -e | grep ^A=
$ bitbake -e | grep ^B=

The "=" operator does not immediately expand variable references in the right-hand side

Instead, expansion is deferred until the variable assigned to is actually used

A = "${B} hello"
B = "${C} world"
C = "linux"

$ bitbake -e | grep ^A=

What happens if C is not defined in above?
--------------------------------------------
the string is kept as is
