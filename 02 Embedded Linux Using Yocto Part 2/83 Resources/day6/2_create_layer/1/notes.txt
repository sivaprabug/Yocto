What is a layer?
----------------

A layer is a logical collection of related recipes.

Types of Layers: oe-core, BSP Layer, application layer

Layer name starts with meta-, but this is not a technical restriction.

Eg. meta-mycustom

Why create a meta layer?
---------------------------

Despite most of the customization can be done with the local.conf configuration file, it is not possible to:

	Store recipes for your own software projects

	Create your own images

	Consolidate patches/modifications to other peopleâ€™s recipes

	Add a new custom kernel

	Add a new machine


Most important point: Do not edit POKY/UPSTREAM Layers, as it complicates future updates
Advantage: This allows you to easily port from one version of Poky to another
