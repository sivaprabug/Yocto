Depending on the type of layer, add the content:

	If the layer is adding support for a machine, add the machine configuration in conf/machine/

	If the layer is adding distro policy, add the distro configuration in conf/distro/

	If the layer introduces new recipes, put the recipes you need in recipes-* subdirectories of the layer directory.

Recipe directories inside layers
-------------------------------

By convention, recipes are splitted into categories

The most difficult part is deciding in which category your recipe will go

By checking what was already done in the official layers should give you a good idea of what you should do

Layer Priority:
---------------

	Each layer has a priority, which is used by bitbake to decide which layer takes precedence if there are recipe files with the same name in multiple layers

	A higher numeric value represents a higher priority.
