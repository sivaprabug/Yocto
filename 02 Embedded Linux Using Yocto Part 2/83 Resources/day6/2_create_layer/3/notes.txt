Creating Layer
-----------------

There are two ways to create your own layer.
1. Manually
2. Using script

Manually:
----------

Step 1 : Create a directory for the layer. For example: 'meta-mylayer'

Step 2 : Create a conf/layer.conf
		You can simply copy meta-oe's one and just change "openembedded-layer" to something appropriate for your layer; you may also want to set the priority as appropriate.

Step 3 : Update bblayers.conf file with the new layer
