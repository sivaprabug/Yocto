What if i have a Makefile which don't have clean target?
-----------------------------------------------------------

CLEANBROKEN = "1"

If set to "1" within a recipe, CLEANBROKEN specifies that the make clean command does not work for the software being built.

Consequently, the OpenEmbedded build system will not try to run make clean during the do_configure task, which is the default behavior.
