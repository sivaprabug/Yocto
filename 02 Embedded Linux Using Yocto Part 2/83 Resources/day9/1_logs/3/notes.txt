Logging Information during task execution
-------------------------------------------

The logging utilities provided by BitBake are very useful to trace the code execution path.

BitBake provides logging functions for use in Python and Shell Script code, as described

Python: For use within Python functions, BitBake supports several log levels, which are bb.fatal, bb.error, bb.warn, bb.note, bb.plain, and bb.debug

Shell Script: For use in Shell Script functions, the same set of log levels exists and is accessed with a similar syntax: bbfatal, bberror, bbwarn, bbnote, bbplain, and bbdebug

There is one subtle difference between the use of the logging functions in Python and Shell Scripting.

The logging functions in Python are directly handled by BitBake, seen on the console, and stored in the execution log that can be seen inside build/tmp/log/cooker/<machine>

When the logging functions are used in Shell Script, the information is outputted on the task's respective task log file, which is available in build/tmp/work/<arch>/<recipe name>/<software version>/temp
