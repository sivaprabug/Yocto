What is an image
--------------------

Image is a top level recipe. (It inherits an image.bbclass)

Building an image creates an entire Linux distribution from source

        Compiler, tools, libraries
        BSP: Bootloader, Kernel
        Root filesystem:
                ● Base OS
                ● services
                ● Applications
                ● etc

Creating custom images
------------------------

You often need to create your own Image recipe in order to add new packages or functionality

Two ways
------------

a) creating an image from scratch
b) extend an existing recipe (preferable)
