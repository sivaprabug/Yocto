Creating an image from scratch
-------------------------------

The simplest way is to inherit the core-image bbclass, as it provides a set of image features that can be used very easily


inherit core-image
Which tells us that the definition of what actually gets installed is defined in the core-image.bbclass.

Image recipes set IMAGE_INSTALL to specify the packages to install into an image through image.bbclass.
 
Create an images directory

$ mkdir -p recipes-examples/images

Create the image recipe

$ vi recipes-examples/images/lwl-image.bb

SUMMARY = "A small boot image for LWL learners"
LICENSE = "MIT"
inherit core-image
# Core files for basic console boot
IMAGE_INSTALL = "packagegroup-core-boot"
IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE ?= "8192"
#Add our needed applications
IMAGE_INSTALL += "usbutils"
