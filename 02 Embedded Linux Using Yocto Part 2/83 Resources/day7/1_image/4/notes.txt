Reusing an existing image
--------------------------

When an image mostly fits our needs and we need to do minor adjustments on it,it is very convenient to reuse its code

This makes code maintenance easier and highlights the functional differences

For example, if we want to include an application (lsusb)

Create another recipe:

$ vim recipes-examples/images/lwl-image-reuse.bb

require recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bb
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils"
