debug-tweaks
---------------

In the default state, local.conf file has EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES set to "debug-tweaks"

debug-tweaks features enable password-less login for the root user

Advantage: makes logging in for debugging or inspection easy during development 

Disadvantage: anyone can easily log in during production.

So, you need to remove the 'debug-tweaks' feature from production image
