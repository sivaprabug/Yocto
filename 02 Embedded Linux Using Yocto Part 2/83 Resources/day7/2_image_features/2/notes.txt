How it works?
---------------

To understand how these features work, the best reference is meta/classes/core-image.bbclass

This class lists out the available IMAGE_FEATURES of which most map to package groups while some, such as debug-tweaks and read-only-rootfs, resolve as general configuration settings

In summary, the file looks at the contents of the IMAGE_FEATURES variable and then maps or configures the feature accordingly

Based on this information, the build system automatically adds the appropriate packages or configurations to the IMAGE_INSTALL variable.
