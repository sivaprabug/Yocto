Example of IMAGE_FEATURES
---------------------------

To illustrate how you can use these variables to modify your image, consider an example that selects the SSH server.

The Yocto Project ships with two SSH servers you can use with your images: Dropbear and OpenSSH. 

OpenSSH is a well-known standard SSH server implementation

Dropbear is a minimal SSH server appropriate for resource-constrained environments

By default, the core-image-sato image is configured to use Dropbear. The core-image-full-cmdline and core-image-lsb images both include OpenSSH.

The core-image-minimal image does not contain an SSH server.
