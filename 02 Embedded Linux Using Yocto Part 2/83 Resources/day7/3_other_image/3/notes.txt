Creating your own image type
------------------------------

If you have a particular layout on your storage (for example bootloader location on an SD card), you may want to create your own image type

This is done through a class that inherits from image_types

It has to define a function named IMAGE_CMD_<type>

Example: sdcard_image-rpi.bbclass in meta-raspberrypi
