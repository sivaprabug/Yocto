What about private repositories? 
--------------------------------

Private repositories have the added complexity of requiring authentication before you can download (a.k.a clone) them. 

Luckily, Yocto supports the ssh protocol.

To make Yocto use a GitHub repository:

SRC_URI="git://git@github.com/group_name/repo_name.git;protocol=ssh"

To use SSH, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub account
