Write a recipe for git remote repository
----------------------------------------

Yocto supports the ability to pull code from online git repositories as part of the build process.

Step 1: Set SRC_URI

SRC_URI = "git://<URL>;protocol=https"

Step 2: Set S environmental variable

S = ${WORKDIR}/git

Step 3: Set SRCREV environmental variable 

What is the use of SRCREV?
--------------------------

When fetching a repository, bitbake uses SRCREV variable to determine the specific revision from which to build

There are two options to this variable:
---------------------------------------

1) AUTOREV:

SRCREV = "${AUTOREV}"

When SRCREV is set to the value of this variable, it specifies to use the latest source revision in the repository

The build system accesses the network in an attempt to determine the latest version of software from the SCM

2) A specific revision (SHA1 hash when fetching from git)

If you want to build a fixed revision and you want to avoid performing a query on the remote repository every time BitBake parses your recipe

SRCREV = "d6918c8832793b4205ed3bfede78c2f915c23385"
