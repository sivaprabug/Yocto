Patches
---------------

Patches can be easily created using Git

If you download the third-party source code as a Git repository, this is definitely the easiest solution

After downloading the repository, make the required changes to the code, and add these changes to the repository as a new commit

You can then tell Git to make a patch file.

If all the changes are contained within a single additional commit, you can use the following command:

~$ git show HEAD > my-patch.patch

These generated patches should be bundled with your recipe files.

Patches should always be in a sub-directory of where the recipe lives.

Yocto will automatically apply these patches when it needs to build your recipe.
