Stage 2: Unpacking (do_unpack)
-------------------------------

All local files found in SRC_URI are copied into the recipeâ€™s working directory, in $BUILDDIR/tmp/work/

When extracting a tarball,BitBake expects to find the extracted files in a directory named <application>-<version>. This is controlled by the S variable.

If the tarball follows the above format, then you need not define S variable

Eg. SRC_URI = "https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-${PV}.tar.bz2;name=tarball

If the directory has another name, you must explicitly define S

If you are fetching from SCM like git or SVN, or your file is local to your machine, you need to define S

If the scheme is git, S = ${WORKDIR}/git
