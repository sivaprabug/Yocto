Licensing
----------------

Your recipe needs to have both the LICENSE and LIC_FILES_CHKSUM variables:

LICENSE:
---------

	This variable specifies the license for the software.

	 If you do not know the license under which the software you are building is distributed, you should go to the source code and look for that information. 

	Typical files containing this information include COPYING, LICENSE, and README files. 

	You could also find the information near the top of a source file. 

For example, given a piece of software licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2, you would set LICENSE as follows:

LICENSE = "GPLv2"

For standard licenses, use the names of the files in meta/files/common-licenses/

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM:
-----------------

The OpenEmbedded build system uses this variable to make sure the license text has not changed.

If it has, the build produces an error and it affords you the chance to figure it out and correct the problem.

Example that assumes the software has a COPYING file:

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=xxx"
