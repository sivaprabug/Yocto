Bitbake
------------

Yocto/OpenEmbedded's build tool bitbake parses a recipe and generates list of tasks that it can execute to perform the build steps

$ bitbake basename

The most important tasks are

do_fetch             Fetches the source code
do_unpack            Unpacks the source code into a working directory
do_patch             Locates patch files and applies them to the source code
do_configure         Configures the source by enabling and disabling any build-time and
                         configuration options for the software being built
do_compile           Compiles the source in the compilation directory
do_install           Copies files from the compilation directory to a holding area
do_package           Analyzes the content of the holding area and splits it into subsets
                         based on available packages and files
do_package_write_rpm Creates the actual RPM packages and places them in the Package Feed area

Generally, the only tasks that the user needs to specify in a recipe are 
	do_configure,
	do_compile and 
	do_install ones. 

The remaining tasks are automatically defined by the YP build system

The above task list is in the correct dependency order. They are executed from top to bottom.

You can use the -c argument to execute the specific task of a recipe.

$ bitbake -c compile dropbear

To list all tasks of a particular recipe

$ bitbake <recipe name> -c listtasks
