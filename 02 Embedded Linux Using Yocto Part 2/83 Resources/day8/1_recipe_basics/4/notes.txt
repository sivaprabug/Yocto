Stage 1: Fetching Code (do_fetch)
----------------------------------

The first thing your recipe must do is specify how to fetch the source files.

Fetching is controlled mainly through the SRC_URI variable

Your recipe must have a SRC_URI variable that points to where the source is located.

The SRC_URI variable in your recipe must define each unique location for your source files.

Bitbake supports fetching source code from git, svn, https, ftp, etc

URI scheme syntax: scheme://url;param1;param2

scheme can describe a local file using file:// or remote locations with https://, git://, svn://, hg://, ftp://

By default, sources are fetched in $BUILDDIR/downloads

Examples of SRC_URI
----------------------

busybox_1.31.0.bb  : SRC_URI = "https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-${PV}.tar.bz2"

linux-yocto_5.2.bb : SRC_URI = "git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto.git"

weston-init.bb	   : SRC_URI = "file://init"

The do_fetch task uses the prefix of each entry in the SRC_URI variable value to determine how to fetch the source code.

Note: Any patch files present, needs to be specified in SRC_URI
