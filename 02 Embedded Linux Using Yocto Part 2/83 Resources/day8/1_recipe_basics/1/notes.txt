Recipes
------------

Recipes are fundamental components in the Yocto Project environment.

A Yocto/OpenEmbedded recipe is a text file with file extension .bb

Each software component built by the OpenEmbedded build system requires a recipe to define the component

A recipe contains information about single piece of software.

What information is present in a recipe?

        Location from which to download the unaltered source
        any patches to be applied to that source (if needed)
        special configuration options to apply
        how to compile the source files and
        how to package the compiled output
