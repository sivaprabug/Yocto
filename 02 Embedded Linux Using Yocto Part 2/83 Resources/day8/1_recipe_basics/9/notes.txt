Stage 5: Compilation (do_compile)
---------------------------------

do_compile task happens after source is fetched, unpacked, and configured.

Stage 6: Installation (do_install)
------------------------------------

After compilation completes, BitBake executes the do_install task

During do_install, the task copies the built files along with their hierarchy to locations that would mirror their locations on the target device.

Stage 7: Packaging (do_package)
--------------------------------

The do_package task splits the files produced by the recipe into logical components.

Even software that produces a single binary might still have debug symbols, documentation, and other logical components that should be split out.

The do_package task ensures that files are split up and packaged correctly.
