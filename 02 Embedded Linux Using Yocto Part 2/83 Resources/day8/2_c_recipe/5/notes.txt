Who defines the fetch, configure and other tasks 
-------------------------------------------------

When bitbake is run to build a recipe, base.bbclass file gets inherited automatically by any recipe

You can find it in classes/base.bbclass

This class contains definitions for standard basic tasks such as fetching, unpacking, configuring (empty by default), compiling (runs any Makefile present), installing (empty by default) and packaging (empty by default)

These classes are often overridden or extended by other classes such as the autotools class or the package class.
