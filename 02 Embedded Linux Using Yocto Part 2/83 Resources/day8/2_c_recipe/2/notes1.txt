The location of the work directory in which the OpenEmbedded build system builds a recipe.

This directory is located within the TMPDIR directory structure and is specific to the recipe being built and the system for which it is being built.

The WORKDIR directory is defined as follows:

${TMPDIR}/work/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}

TMPDIR: The top-level build output directory
MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS: The target system identifier
PN: The recipe name
EXTENDPE: Mostly blank
