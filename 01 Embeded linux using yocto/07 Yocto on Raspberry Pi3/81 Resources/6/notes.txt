Booting Process in Raspberry Pi3
---------------------------------

Stage 2 Booting - bootcode.bin
------------------------------

	GPU - On, CPU - Off, SDRAM - On

	Executed on VideoCore GPU
	Enables SDRAM
	Loads the third stage bootloader start.elf into SDRAM

Stage 3 Booting - start.elf
----------------------------

	GPU - On, CPU - On, SDRAM - On

	start.elfÂ is actually a full fledge proprietary operating system for GPU known as VCOS (VideoCore OS).
	It starts by reading config.txt  which contains configuration parameters for
		VideoCore (Video/HDMI modes, memory, console frame buffers etc) and
		Linux Kernel (load addresses, device tree, uart/console baud rates etc)
		kernel = kernel7.img
	It also loads a file cmdline.txt if it exists, and will pass its contents as kernel command line
	Finally enables the ARM CPU and loads the kernel image which is executed on the ARM CPU
	It also loads the dtb file
