Booting Process in Raspberry Pi3
---------------------------------

Broadcom BCM2837:
	CPU 	-	1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 Cortex-A53
	GPU 	-	Broadcom VideoCore IV
	SDRAM	-	1024 MiB

When you power the device
Stage 1 Booting - OnChip ROM
----------------------------
	GPU - On, CPU - Off, SDRAM - Off

	When the Pi is powered up the first thing that starts working is the GPU core and ARM CPU is held in reset

	The GPU core is the main part responsible for the first booting steps of the Pi. 

	Inside Broadcomâ€™s SoC, there is a small boot ROM, its programmed by default to look for a file called
	bootcode.bin on the SD Card

	It loads bootcode.bin into L2 Cache memory
